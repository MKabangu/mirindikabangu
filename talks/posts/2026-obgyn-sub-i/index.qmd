title: "Addressing Disparities in Uterine Fibroid Embolization"

abstract: |
  This project traces the evolution of embolization from its origins in managing postpartum hemorrhage to its adaptation for fibroid treatment, highlighting the central importance of ultrasound and MRI in diagnosis, classification, and procedural planning. The work emphasizes how uterine artery embolization expands patient-centered treatment options beyond traditional surgery and addresses persistent disparities in fibroid burden and care, particularly among African American women, framing interventional radiology as a key contributor to equitable, contemporary gynecologic management.
